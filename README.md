# Attendance System – Raspberry Pi 3

A real-time face-recognition attendance system designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 3. It captures video from the Pi Camera, detects faces with OpenCV, and identifies them using AWS Rekognition. The result is displayed in a fullscreen Tkinter UI.

## Features

- Fullscreen UI built with Tkinter
- Live camera feed via Picamera2
- Face detection using OpenCV Haar cascades
- Face recognition using AWS Rekognition
- Threaded AWS calls to keep the UI responsive
- Recognition triggered only when a face is large enough (nearby), with a 3-second cooldown

## Requirements

### Hardware

- Raspberry Pi 3
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module (v1, v2, or HQ)

### Software

- Python 3.8+
- [Picamera2](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2)
- OpenCV (`opencv-python` or the system `python3-opencv` package)
- Pillow
- Boto3

Install dependencies:

```bash
# On Raspberry Pi OS – install system packages first (recommended)
sudo apt install python3-picamera2 python3-opencv

# Then install the remaining Python packages into your virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** `picamera2` and `opencv4` are best installed via `apt` on Raspberry Pi OS
> because they depend on native system libraries. The `requirements.txt` covers the
> rest (`boto3`, `Pillow`). If you are running outside Raspberry Pi OS, you can also
> `pip install picamera2 opencv-python` directly.

### AWS Setup

1. Create an AWS Rekognition **Face Collection** named `attendance_collection`:
   ```bash
   aws rekognition create-collection --collection-id attendance_collection
   ```

2. Index the faces you want to recognize (one image per person). Use the person's name as `ExternalImageId`:
   ```bash
   aws rekognition index-faces \
     --collection-id attendance_collection \
     --image "S3Object={Bucket=your-bucket,Name=john_doe.jpg}" \
     --external-image-id "John Doe"
   ```

3. Configure AWS credentials on the Raspberry Pi:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```
   Provide your `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and preferred region (e.g. `eu-west-1`).

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

The application launches in fullscreen mode. To mark attendance, a person simply walks up close to the camera. Once the face is detected at sufficient size, the system automatically queries AWS Rekognition and displays the recognized name (green) or "Unknown" (red) on screen — no touching or interaction required.

Press **Esc** to quit (development mode).

## How It Works

1. `CameraService` continuously captures frames from the Pi Camera at 640 × 480.
2. `MainWindow` processes every third frame to reduce CPU load.
3. `FaceService` runs an OpenCV Haar-cascade detector on a downscaled (320 × 240) copy of the frame.
4. If a detected face is wide enough (> 120 px at original resolution) and the 3-second cooldown has elapsed, a background thread is spawned.
5. `AWSService` encodes the cropped face as JPEG and calls `search_faces_by_image` against the Rekognition collection.
6. The status label is updated with the result.
